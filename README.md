### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

In flexbox changing position of two items or element is easy. But with CSS grid it's kinda complicated i learnt how to do it with CSS grid on this project.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  order: 1;
}
```

### Continued development

I'll just say the grid i know it pretty well. But i think i'll have to develop there in future projects.
